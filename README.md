## 💡 Working with `main`

To keep our codebase stable and encourage collaboration, please **use Pull Requests (PRs) instead of pushing directly to the `main` branch**.

**Workflow:**
1. Create a new branch based on `main`.
2. Open a Pull Request describing your changes.
3. A team member (code owner) will review and approve your PR.
4. Once approved, your changes can be merged into `main`.

_This approach helps us review and improve each other's work before it goes live._
